## Project 2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ -> Math Program

### about the project:
 
 math program using tkinter, threding, numpy, sympy, matplotlib and PIL. when every subject in mathematics is a world. When I did three worlds. The trig world, the world of integrals, and the world of limits. Three important branches of mathematics.
 
When in the trig world there are calculations of degrees to radians. In addition, there is a place where you enter a trigonometric function that you want with the parameters that you want and it creates a separate page for you with the function.

And in addition there is the use of a file system in which I prepared a summary for each topic and you can write in it and move between the summaries.

In the world of limits there is the definition of lim. and a calculator for calculating limits. You enter the function and the point where you want the limit to be calculated and it calculates it for you even if you want infinity.

In the world of integrals you have an integral calculator. where you can write the function you want to integrate and its limits and it calculates it for you. I really enjoyed building out this project as I learned a lot from it.
